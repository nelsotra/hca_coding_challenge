# Overview
This repository contains the files necessary for the HCA coding challenge.
The instructions were:
 - Web application to upload data.tsv
 - Backend persistent system to hold the data (I used Google Cloud Datastore)
 - Calculate and display the total revenue (item_price * item_count)
 - Handle Errors Gracefully
 - Let the user upload multiple times
 - Document everything needed to build the project from scratch

# My Solution
 - To solve this problem, I created a web app with Google App Engine, using Python.  The HTML for the page is integrated into the Python code and the backend is handled by the Google Cloud Datastore (a NoSQL database).  

# Instructions
 - Specific instructions that detail how to build the project are included in a separate pdf file, called Instructions.pdf 

# URL
 - The url for the web app is: https://hca-coding-challenge-travis.appspot.com
